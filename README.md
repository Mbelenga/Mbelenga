👋 Hello there! I'm Terrence Mbelenga, a passionate software engineering student at ALX. 🚀

💻 I'm on a journey to transform my love for technology into innovative solutions and meaningful code. As a student, I'm constantly exploring new horizons in the world of software development.

🌱 My interests span a wide range of tech,and I'm always eager to learn something new.

🧩 Problem-solving is my favourite game, and I enjoy the process of breaking down complex challenges into manageable pieces. Collaboration and teamwork are also values I hold dear in this interconnected world.

🔧 Currently, I'm sharpening my coding skills, learning new languages and frameworks, and building some cool projects along the way. I'm looking forward to contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with the tech community.

✈️ Am also an aviation enthusiast.
